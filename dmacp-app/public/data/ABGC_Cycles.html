The Anthropocene Working Group is preparing the case for the definition of a new stratigraphic Epoch: this requires the demonstration of an objective change in properties of a geological archive over time. As each property being examined for this distinction can be considered as a time series, we encounter a classic scientific problem of distinguishing a signal from noise. We need to understand the reasons why a signal of change should exist in order to know how to look for it—for example, in what chemical form would a new pollutant emerge? We also need a theory (a model) of the noise—over time, how large are the natural background fluctuations, and what are their properties? A familiar example of this challenge is the tricky problem of distinguishing long-term climate change from the background of weather events. In this essay we examine these issues with respect to several chemical signals of environmental change which reflect global (anthro-)(bio-)geochemical cycles. To begin, we see what can be learned from the extensive measurements of sea-level change: an instructive example for a high-quality source of data with considerable noise in terms of geographic variation.

       automatic tide gauges, which allowed continuous water height measurements, were invented
       </span>
       in the 1930s. Sea level at a given location represents the mean height of the water surface relative to the underlying geological
       substrate. Establishing this mean requires time-averaging myriad fluctuations related to climatic and geophysical
       factors (Masson-Delmotte et al. 2013). Tides, for example, display a range of variabilities on longer timescales
       than the familiar diurnal variation, and year-to-year variations in storminess can be significant sources of noise.
       While tide gauges provide data that is highly precise and accurate in relation to time and space, their signal is local,
       and as we examine below, their noise is related to geographic variations.

   The timing of the measured sea-level inflections matches, with a delay of about a decade, the stepped changes in atmospheric
   carbon dioxide concentrations (Summerhayes and Cearreta 2019). Additional noise in the time domain of the calculated global mean trends of sea level is observed to coincide with volcanic eruptions (negative deviations) and the 2016 Super El Niño and
   2011 La Niña events (positive and negative deviations, respectively), as can be seen in the Global Mean Sea Level chart provided by the University of Colorado. Other processes, such as ocean dynamics, tectonics, or glacial isostatic adjustment are spatially
   variable and cause sea-level rise to vary (usually very slowly) in rate and magnitude between different regions. Local and
   regional changes in these climatic and geophysical factors produce significant deviations from a global average rate of
   sea-level change (Masson-Delmotte et al. 2013). These dynamics are well illustrated by the interactive graphics at the Permanent Service for Mean Sea Level (PSMSL) based at the National Oceanography Centre in Liverpool.

  work of the chemist and Nobel laureate Harold Urey

  in the late 1940s. Workers have traditionally used mass spectrometry to make extremely precise measurements of the ratio of abundance of a rare isotope such as 18O (spoken as oxygen-18
  ) to a common isotope such as 16O on a gas produced in the laboratory from the material (e.g. water or calcium carbonate). The ratios
  are normally expressed as the delta value, e.g. δ18O, a number in parts per thousand (‰) expressing the relative abundance of 18O to
  16O. Lower delta values mean both less 18O as seen in water vapor compared with its source water, and in a progressively greater lowering
  of 18O in rain and snow from cooling air masses. Hence ice sheets, primarily formed from evaporation from sea water, have very low delta
  values which, during an ice age, lead to a higher δ18O value of the remaining seawater. The larger the mass of ice, the larger this
  ice-volume effect.

Although a (small) oxygen isotope (δ18O) signal does mark the base of our current interglacial period (the Holocene) in a Greenland

<h3>The carbon cycle and sulphur in the atmosphere</h3>

<p id="P12">
A primary driver of global warming is the burning of fossil fuels which have created a first-order change in the carbon cycle. Fluxes
       of carbon between reservoirs have increased, and carbon, mainly as carbon dioxide, is increasingly stored in the atmosphere.
       This newly released carbon has a distinct fingerprint in terms of the ratio of the stable isotopes of carbon (13C/12C) as determined
       from mass spectrometry. Expressed in terms of the delta number (δ13C), the rare 13C is much less abundant in the biosphere (δ13C
       around -25‰), and thus in fossil fuels that stem from organic material, than in the pre-industrial atmosphere (-6.5‰). Hence
       atmospheric CO2 trapped in ice cores shows an inverse relationship to δ13C, known as the
       <span resource="#suess_effect_inflection" typeof="time:Instant">
         <meta property="time:inXSDgYear" content="1965" />
         <meta property="rdfs:label" content="Around 1965 CE" />
         <meta property="ac:hasIndefiniteness" content="0.2" />
       Suess effect, with a pronounced inflection
       </span>
       around 1965 CE. This signal in ice cores shows little noise because it reflects the composition of a well-mixed atmosphere. It
       therefore compares in quality with that of radioactive species such as radiocarbon and plutonium released through atmospheric
       nuclear tests. Carbon isotopes in other archives typically show a less clear-cut relationship because of the complexities of
       biochemical cycling. For example, this signal is masked altogether in cave carbonates (speleothems) because of large fractionations
       in carbon isotopes in cave systems. Trees provide an interesting intermediate example where, although the carbon fixed is derived
       directly from the atmosphere, seasonal to decadal changes in tree physiology add noise to the Suess effect. However, in the dataset
       shown below (from Loader et al., 2013) a moving average of the
       <span resource="#atmospheric_signal_data_inflection" typeof="time:Instant">
         <meta property="time:inXSDgYear" content="1960" />
         <meta property="rdfs:label" content="Around 1960 CE" />
         <meta property="ac:hasIndefiniteness" content="0.2" />
       data reveals the underlying atmospheric signal, with an inflection
       </span>
       around 1960 CE. Marine records, such as from corals, also demonstrate a clear signal (Figure 3).
</p>

<p id="P13">
A contrasting example is provided by sulphur in the atmosphere. It is released naturally from volcanic eruptions, but emissions
  increased enormously because of industrial processes, particularly the burning of sulphurous coal. Because this sulphur is in
  the form of microscopic aerosol particles, the abundance of sulphur in geological archives and its stable isotope composition
  show regional variations (Fairchild 2019). For example,

    </span>
  trees and speleothems in Europe show a mid-twentieth century rise followed by a fall reflecting changes in this industrial activity.
  </span>
  These records rely on micro-scale analytical techniques at specialized facilities, such as ion probes or the fluorescence produced by X-rays in huge synchrotron facilities. Both are anthrobiogeochemical
  records since the O and S isotopes in sulphate in rainfall become fractionated when stored in soil humic substances. This pollution
  indicator is also seen as an anthrogeochemical (i.e. non-biological) signal in Greenland ice, but is absent in Antarctic ice cores.

       the nitrogen cycle, along with the burning of fossil fuels and symbiotic nitrogen fixation by bacteria hosted by cultivated plants.

<p id="P15">
An excess of nitrogen causes a negative impact on all environmental compartments. In surface waters it brings about eutrophication,
  leads to a deficit in oxygen (hypoxia) into the sea, and a decreased input of dissolved silica soils, excessive amounts of nitrogen
  cause acidification and decreased biodiversity. It also diminishes the quality of air through the formation of particulate matter
  and ozone. The above examples of complex environmental impacts are often referred to as a “nitrogen cascade.”
</p>

<p id="P16">
Nitrogen has two stable isotopes, 14N and 15N, with 14N making up 99.63 percent of all nitrogen occurring in nature. Anthropogenic
       sources produce a change of nitrogen stable isotope ratios in different environmental archives. This change may potentially
       be used as a signal of the Anthropocene. Sample analysis is again by mass spectrometry with preparation techniques tailored
       to create gas for analysis from materials such as organic matter or ice. The increase in concentrations of nitrogen compounds
       in the environment, especially from fossil fuel burning, is usually accompanied by a decrease in δ15N values. For example,

       The increase observed in the late 1980s/early 1990s was caused by a growing input of sewage to the Pearl River estuary
       </span>
       (Figure 4). Nitrification (oxidation of NH4+ from sewage to nitrites
       and nitrates) and subsequent denitrification (reduction of nitrates to N2O and N2) caused an increase in the δ15N values because
       the products of denitrification were enriched in the lighter N isotope, whereas the remaining inorganic N species were enriched
       in 15N. It is fortunate that despite the complexities of the biogeochemical cycling of different nitrogen species, both the
       nitrogen isotope records of nitrate and the organic carbon fraction reflect environmental change. The observed trends in the
       δ15N values of different environmental archives reflect a combination of natural- and human-driven processes, thus confirming
       the usefulness of stable nitrogen isotopes for our understanding of anthrobiogeochemical nitrogen cycles.

<h3>The legacy of lead</h3>

<p id="P17">
Trace metals are integral parts of natural element cycles and, before human interference, came mainly from geo-/lithogenic sources via
  the weathering of rocks. We focus here on lead (Pb), as it is relatively common in the Earth’s crust (average 14 ppm) compared to
  other trace metals, has been widely mined or formed a by-product of mining since prehistoric times, and is identified as a highly
  toxic element, making the monitoring of Pb contamination as well as searches for its provenance a critical issue in geological,
  environmental, and public research. Beginning as early as thousands of years BCE, the

      <meta property="ac:hasIndefiniteness" content="0.6" />
    </span>
  increased availability of anthropogenic trace metals in the environment, and thus their involvement in anthrobiogeochemical cycles, began with the mining of ores and other raw
  materials for use in various industrial processes
  </span>
  : initially lead was merely a by-product, and only later was mined directly.
</p>

<p id="P18">
Many different techniques are used to determine total Pb concentrations in samples, and the analytical precision of these techniques
       is far less than the sample-to-sample variation. Ratios of stable isotopes such as 206Pb, 207Pb, and 208Pb analyzed by different
       types of mass spectrometry can be used to distinguish the sources of contamination by lead in the environment, e.g. in assessing
       the relative contributions from mining against natural background values (e.g. Gałuszka and Wagreich 2019). Natural background
       fluctuations vary across orders of magnitude, driven by local high-lead sources like ores, variabilities in input from weathering,
       and sediment dilution. Remote archives such as ice sheets largely show inputs of natural dust particles, contaminated by
       anthropogenic emissions such as those from lead in petrol. Because ice sheets are remote, background concentrations of Pb
       in Arctic and Antarctic ice cores range from a few to a few tens of parts-per thousand, whereas in other archives, such as
       lakes and bogs, natural background concentrations are mainly around tens of parts-per million (Gałuszka and Wagreich 2019).

Later, silver, and thus also lead, mining and usage increased substantially during Roman times, which lead to significant human

       is recognized in ice cores, estuaries, bogs, and remote lakes of the Northern Hemisphere; a Spanish source for the lead was
       revealed by isotope studies (Wagreich and Draganits 2018).

Global lead production and usage only began to rise again with silver production in medieval times.
  This was followed by an even larger rise due to silver mining and production in the New World, with abundant production and use punctuated by plagues and wars.

<h3>The Anthropocene signal amidst the noise</h3>

<p id="P22">
The large amounts of industrially-produced pollutants and emissions that have been introduced, over decades and centuries,
       into air, soil, and water have caused considerable changes to natural phenomena, such as the cycling of elements and
       changes in sea level. However, the Anthropocene signals lie amidst noise which arises for several reasons. One is the
       issue in making measurements with sufficient precision (easy for tide gauges, but tricky for some rare isotopes). Another
       is the geographic variability of many parameters. A third is the presence of natural variability over time. Despite these
       problems, many different types of anthropogenic signals have become increasingly prominent and isolatable since the middle
       of the twentieth century.
