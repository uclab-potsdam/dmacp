The rivalry between the living and constructed realms goes well beyond a kind of face-off in mass equivalence: it becomes a war with many casualties, and the living side bears the brunt of it.

      To understand the phenomenon of technofossils, we need to go further back in time to set the framework (or multiple frameworks). The very word “technofossil” is a reframing of the venerable term “artifact” to emphasize that many of these objects will enter the
      fossil record, and may be used—in the near or far future—like the traditional zone fossils, such as

      use to age-date strata. Moreover, as these objects enter
      the fossil record, one can bring the dark arts of taphonomy to bear, forward-modeling
      how, and in what form, these objects will survive within strata over geological timescales. This, though, is not a simple exercise in telling catchy stories of the far future. The very act of fossilization means passing through, and interacting with, the living, sensitive “critical zone” that surrounds our planet. A plastic bag, for instance, might ultimately

But, in passing from the surface to its ultimate burial, the bag may have choked a seagull, trapped some marine worms on the sea floor and, as a novel barrier to water and oxygen, formed different microbial micro-communities on its lower and upper surfaces that would react differently to the conditions of ever-deeper burial—before that subterranean life eventually winks out,

Here, the contrasts in methodological, analytical, and philosophical approaches between archaeology and paleontology might be fruitfully explored, with the aim of encouraging cross-collaborative discussions which would help us understand this enormous and rapidly evolving phenomenon. Archaeology has a long tradition and practice of collecting, classifying, interpreting, and curating artifacts of all kinds, a tradition almost entirely lacking in geology (except when collaborating—with archaeologists, naturally—on

        strata). This knowledge and experience could usefully inform a paleontologist’s
        approach, whose natural reflex might be to try out Linnaean biological classification
        on technofossils, placing (for example) a Bic Cristal ballpoint pen species within
        a (large and diverse) ballpoint pen genus, within a family of pens (including fountain
        and felt tip pens), within an order of writing implements (in which pencils and crayons
        might be located), all these being within a phylum of communicative technology (which
        could inspire fierce discussions over whether or not it would include computers and
        televisions). Such an approach would be fascinating, if prone to being instantly
        overwhelmed by the huge scale and explosive growth of technodiversity—not to
        mention the cumbersome processes of biological taxonomy, which demands the formal
        selection of type specimens and the involvement of committees in nomenclatural changes
        for individual species. Taxonomic systems, however, reflect evolutionary patterns, and
        technofossil evolution differs from biological evolution, as we discuss below.

        . Geological studies also interpret modern waste and debris—but mostly on a large and relatively crude scale, where they are treated as sedimentary units to be mapped out, and their general properties assessed. Attempts to deal with the fine, technopaleontological detail contained within these deposits are just beginning, specifically as attempts to link waste and debris with still-functional constructions in same way that fossils are routinely compared with modern biological organisms. There is enormous potential to understand this phenomenon better in these kinds of ways—even as our contemporary material culture continues to grow and evolve around us.

        Archaeologists traditionally deal with technofossils made of novel materials—pottery, glass, concrete, brick, tile, and now increasingly plastics and other modern materials—which are commonly found as inclusions in archaeological strata. These are used to date and correlate layers and features in ways broadly analogous with how geologists use fossils of natural organisms. However, methods of stratigraphic analysis have to be adjusted somewhat to take into account important differences between technofossils and “natural” fossils. An obvious point is that whereas the evolution of biological organisms is determined by natural selection acting upon the physical expression of genetic coding, technofossils are subject to cultural selection pressures and only indirectly to forces of natural selection. This can lead to significant differences between their patterns of distribution in the stratigraphic record. Another difference is that the processes of fossilization through which the remains of natural organisms get to be preserved in strata might, in classical geology, be considered entirely natural. However, in the case of technofossils, these processes may be technological as well, with questions of the intentional design or cultural style coming into play. A brick is a good example: first made from clay molded into a required shape and heated in a brick kiln, it spends its useful life in the functioning technosphere as part of a structure, and afterwards it might end up in urban archaeosphere layers of accumulated occupation debris and building rubble, or be deposited back in the ground as landfill. The brick does not need to wait millions of years for geological processes of lithification (hardening) to occur: It has already been turned to stone, in a kiln rather than in sedimentary settings, with a strong potential for long-term preservation as a fossil on geological timescales. Thus even its entry into stratigraphic contexts is culturally and technologically mediated.

        Archaeological methodologies have evolved to deal specifically with such objects and materials, and take due account of the factors described above. Typologies and seriation charts used for pottery can be adapted for use with other novel materials, such as plastics. Of particular consideration is the technofossil within its stratigraphic context. The information it can convey is—as with fossils in ancient strata—multiplied many times by taking into consideration the total assemblage of technofossils and novel materials along with other environmental evidence, such as animal bones found together in a particular layer, and the position of that layer within a broader stratigraphic sequence of archaeological cuts and deposits. The technofossil has potential to reveal information not only about itself and its own mode of manufacture or use, or about the layer within which it was found, but also about larger structures and features in the archaeological record. A single technofossil or novel material such as a fragment of pottery (which can be dated by reference to similar pottery found in other correlatable contexts)—if it is found beneath a wall or in a layer cut by building foundation trenches—can help to date the whole building or complex of buildings (just as a single trilobite fragment can date a stratal succession to a precise level in the Palaeozoic) and at wider levels, provide information on patterns of trade.

        Technofossils, and the new materials of their construction, are just the residue of a process—or rather, of many variably interlinked processes and forces: supply chains, investment hubs, research institutes, factories, courts of law, pubs, power stations, football stadiums, prisons, advertising agencies, army barracks, farms, across the garden fence, and in other countless and diverse nodes of human influence and action that combine within the technosphere. In the same way, biofossils are the residue of a network of interlinked biological and geological processes that, together, define the biosphere and underpin its actions.

        One way of tying together the stratigraphic classification of objects as different as biofossils and technofossils is to take advantage of the fact that both indirectly record steps in the evolution of knowledge. The role of knowledge merits attention  because it plays a central role in the appearance of technology, and thus in the emergence of the technosphere from the biosphere.[note]Jürgen Renn, <em>The Evolution of Knowledge: Rethinking Science for the Anthropocene</em>. Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2020.[/note] Knowledge can be understood as information that has causal effect, and that has the potential to evolve by transforming itself and its environment in a way favorable to its own survival.[note]David Deutsch,<em>The Beginning of Infinity: Explanations that Transform the World</em>. New York: Viking, 2011.[/note] This physical definition applies to information in DNA, which propagates according to Darwinian mechanisms and, in the process, helps construct its immediate environment (the organism itself) and alter its surroundings (niche construction) in a manner that enhances its own survivability. One of the products of the evolution of non-cognitive genetic knowledge was the human brain, an organ able to create and store causal information in patterns of neural synapses. Lacking the Darwinian constraint to replicate itself accurately, such human cognitive knowledge was able to evolve and impact the world in a way relatively unconstrained by biology.

        The characteristic entities of the technosphere and biosphere, i.e., artifacts and organisms, can serve as durable proxies for the underlying technological and biological information they contain as they provide the raw material for fossilization. Changes in organismal information, transmitted between generations via Darwinian evolution, most commonly result in only incremental differences in organismal body design. Although DNA information tends to fade with time after an individual organism dies, corresponding structural information can persist in the architecture of biofossils. Where the resulting biofossil record is locally non-incremental, one may infer that the discontinuity is due to causes such as erosion, rather than to a sudden change in organismal design.

      <p id="P13" prefix="time: http://www.w3.org/2006/time# ac: http://anthropocene-curriculum.org/tbd rdfs: http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#">
        In contrast, technological artifacts, enabled by the fluidity of information freed from the chemical bondage of DNA, can evolve rapidly in giant Lamarckian-like steps, leaving a technofossil record marked by discontinuities that reflect the saltatory nature of technological change. As a consequence of these jumps in design, the resulting technofossils cannot be relied on to carry with them intrinsic evidence of their temporal relationship to earlier technofossils. Information missing from the technofossil record must be provided from an independent but correlatable data repository. Such an external record, as compiled for example from archaeological findings and the history of technology and science, offers a stand-in for the continuity that characterizes biological change. The required external record, residing for example in the cultural knowledge in books, universities, and museums, and in the cognitive knowledge in the brains of living scientists and historians, is a product of the technosphere. Thus the evolution of technological knowledge, in addition to generating a cryptic sequence of technofossils, also provides, in a continuously updated form, the key to deciphering the technofossil text. This makes it possible to avoid ad hoc organizational schemes for the classification of technofossils, such as those based on form or inferred function, and instead to adopt a cladistics approach similar to that in biology, i.e., an ordering system that respects the causal chain connecting successive generations of technology.

        The necessity of relying on cultural information for understanding technofossils is not a sign that technofossils should be unacceptable as part of the geological record. Indeed, biofossil classification is similarly dependent on knowledge residing in the technosphere. The extension to technofossils simply reflects the fact that in the Anthropocene, cognitive and cultural knowledge has influenced planetary dynamics sufficiently rapidly and profoundly to

        . Yet concrete is a rock, a little like a sandy limestone, generally inert if not altogether non-toxic (through its highly alkaline nature). Large amounts of pure (or alloyed) metals have been brought to Earth’s surface, like iron, copper, and aluminum—the metals themselves are not generally regarded as pollutants (although the separation of these metals from their native ores may be highly polluting). Plastics, though, are something different.[note]Sarah Gabbott, Sarah Key, Catherine Russell, Yasmin Yonan, and Jan Zalasiewicz, “The Geography and Geology of Plastics: Their Environmental Distribution and Fate,” <em>Plastic Waste and Recycling: Environmental Impact, Societal Issues, Prevention and Solutions</em>, ed. Trevor M. Letcher. Cambridge, MA: Academic Press, 2020, pp. 33–36.[/note] Even though they are among the most chemically inert of all of the novel materials, their relative inertness, combined with their strength and lightness, is exactly what makes them so troublesome.

        Plastic bags can be blown like leaves by the wind, reaching places far away from their initial sources. As discussed above, when landing in the soil, bags do not mulch down as leaves do, but just… remain. If buried and out of the reach of UV radiation from the sun, they might stay intact for decades, centuries—or perhaps even longer, even while being disturbed by the action of worms, moles, and percolating water, and slowly shifting their position via soil creep and other mass movement processes. Although this kind of long-term longevity is an open question, current evidence suggests that plastics can be preserved at least within human timescales, and for some perhaps far longer;

        , after all, has no problem surviving, buried in strata, on multimillion-year timescales. That is, however, not surprising, because plastics are resistant to most forms of degradation by design. Plastics are manufactured to be durable, and most of the plastics that now migrate between different environmental compartments are not those with long lifecycles, such as machines and vehicles or the fridge in your kitchen, but those with short lifecycles, such as the plastic bag blown away by the wind. If at the surface and attacked by UV radiation, plastics simply fragment into smaller pieces of plastic which can stay there or travel on. In general, the smaller the fragment of plastic, the higher its potential to be transported within and among compartments. This very mobility has allowed microplastics (<5 mm) to become a ubiquitous component of the surface layers of all ocean sediments, even in remote regions or at profound water depths. This means that in all oceans a

On land, a large proportion of contemporary agricultural soils is also heavily polluted with microplastics which have been spread through the application of organic compost and sewage sludge. The hyper-rapid evolution in plastic polymer technologies (PET, PP, PVC etc.) can even record decadal shifts in abundance that may date post-1950 sediments, as we have shown above. Some plastics might even be considered extinct.

        It is hard to think of a geological equivalent, physically or chemically, for plastics. As larger fragments, amber and related solid hydrocarbons come close, but they are too rare to have wider environmental impacts. The tough natural polymer coats of pollen and spores could make good analogues for microplastics, but millions of years of evolution has enabled biological digestion processes to evolve which can break down these materials—not least by honeybees, which can use pollen as a primary food source (one, these days, sometimes hijacked by health-conscious humans). One might have to go to other planetary bodies to find analogues for abundant, undigested polymerized hydrocarbons at the surface—such as Saturn’s moon, Titan, where such solid particles are thought to make up the spectacular wind-blown dunefields there. In many ways, plastics are an alien material for Earth, and developing an effective conceptual framework for plastics is one of the challenges they present us in the Anthropocene.

        A technosphere in overdrive

        Technofossils, whether of plastic or of other materials, are at a stage of development that gives much food for thought. Their ever-faster increases in bulk and sophistication, as a key component of a technosphere in overdrive, take place largely at the expense of a diminishing biosphere, amid a heating climate and rising sea levels that may be also counted as spin-offs of the technosphere’s construction. Will that furious evolution continue, as new forms spring up to help their parent humans cope with, and perhaps ameliorate, an increasingly perilous environment in this new kind of arms race? Or will the technosphere, and its cornucopia of material inventions, be choked off as its biological foundations give way underneath it? Or might technofossils even dispense with their biological foundations to become wholly silicon-based, sustaining themselves on a Hothouse Earth inimical to complex organic life? That last option still seems a little out of reach, but one never knows. In whatever form, this story looks like it will still develop some fascinating, if not always comforting, chapters.
