      Extinction, coupled with many other biological signals, is a major geological indicator of the Anthropocene (Barnosky et al. 2011). The introduction of non-native species, deforestation, depletion of fisheries and modification of coastal environments, domestication of animals, and the reconfiguration of terrestrial ecosystems are all evident in the geological record and are being explored by the Anthropocene Working Group (AWG) and many other investigators. This essay begins by outlining the geological record of life over four billion years, the calamities that have occasionally erased much of its diversity, and the more recent human impacts upon it. We show that lakes, seas, estuaries and wetlands provide important archives of humanity’s reconfiguration of life, and we speculate on the biological and paleontological signature of the near future.

        cyanobacteria (“blue-green algae”) had harnessed the energy of light
      </span>
      to forge biological mass from water and carbon dioxide, releasing oxygen as a “waste” by-product. For much of the early life oxygen was toxic, but other organisms learned to use this “waste” to release more energy through respiration. The ability of life to reuse “waste” is one of its enduring structures, but human ecologies produce so much that Earth is once again in a phase of toxification.

      2.7 million years ago occurred when North and South America became joined at the Isthmus of Panama. Organisms moved both ways between the continents, but physical barriers in the north—a desert to cross in Mexico—and the absence of placental mammals in the south informed the way that ecosystems responded to the exchange. Such insights, even from the remote geological past, can help us to understand which of Earth’s ecologies are resilient, and which—like coral reefs and the many species that are nearly extinct—may not be.

      during the early twentieth-century “Scramble for Africa.” In eastern North America, European settlement was synonymous with land clearing, where settlers replaced the mixed and deciduous forests with artificial grasslands. This allowed weeds like ragweed (the not-so-aptly named Ambrosia) to proliferate, to the ongoing dismay of allergy sufferers. Contrary to a popular misconception, ragweed was not introduced to North America—it is native to the grasslands in the center of the continent—but the abundance of its pollen grains is a marker of regional land clearing throughout eastern North America. In all, some 95 percent of the Earth’s ice-free landscape is modified in some way by humans (Kennedy et al. 2019); more recently the oceans also show significant evidence of human impact (Halpern et al. 2008).

      To define a geological boundary, a surface of equivalent time everywhere is needed—an isochronous surface that can be recognized in geological successions globally. Many boundaries in deep time are marked by the first appearance of a particular fossil—such as the mouthparts of a species of marine vertebrates named conodonts in the case of the Triassic System (252 million years ago). This marker, or index fossil, is not present in rocks everywhere, but is sufficiently widespread to enable a chain of correlation with other fossil species of the same age, and with geochemical or other stratigraphical markers. Similar chains of correlation will be needed to identify the Anthropocene.

      Lakes are important continental ecosystems that have been cradles of evolution. Human settlements in their catchments were provided with freshwater, but the lakes received the waste generated by agriculture and industry, and this impairment is recorded by the fossil record of the entire lake ecosystems. The most commonly studied lacustrine microfossils are the glassy remains of diatoms, but many other algae and their consumers—including microscopic invertebrates—preserve in the sediments, allowing entire food webs to be reconstructed. Pollen grains and other remains of terrestrial organisms (including pathogens) that blow or wash into lakes link the surrounding catchment to the lake, allowing cause and effect to be shown between human activities including land clearing and the introduction of exotic species, and the impairment of lake ecosystems. Nutrient loading (eutrophication) has several harmful effects on lakes, including the promotion of harmful algal blooms and the production of anoxic “dead zones.” The associated risks to public health include those posed by harmful algal blooms to the municipal water supply of communities. These have drawn a great deal of attention, but the stresses placed on ecosystems are visible in the turnover in microfossil assemblages in lake sediments long before the impacts are felt directly by humans. For example, lakes in regions with little capacity to buffer against acid rain are stressed by mining and smelting ores and the burning of fossil fuels—especially sulfur-rich coal. Increased acidity mobilizes toxins, making them bioavailable, and this can be seen in deformities in the fossil record of aquatic organisms preserved in the sediments that accumulate in the quiet depths of lake basins. In the best cases, when water does not mix to the lakebed, the past is recorded as annual or even seasonal layers, so that a year-by-year chronicle can be read over thousands of years. These layers of sediment, called varves, can be recovered using freeze cores, hollow metal tubes filled with a slurry of dry ice and ethanol that instantly freezes a rind of lake sediment into which it is pushed, and they can be subsampled and analysed to provide annual resolution for chemical, physical or biological constituents of the lake’s sediment archive.

      Knowing how reef ecologies responded to past environmental change (including past mass extinction events) might provide insights to future patterns (Leinfelder 2019). Some living reefs thrive in muddy and silty conditions, often in nutrient-rich shallow waters that still resemble the habitats of ancient reefs. With extensive mitigation including preventing overfishing, coastal pollution, and urbanization—and above all, reducing greenhouse gas emissions—coral reefs can continue to grow, albeit in a different form, and possibly thrive well into the future.

      from the 1960s (Hou et al. 2019). The specific proxy measured is the relative amount of two isotopes of carbon, 12C and 13C, denoted as a ratio ‘δ13C’ within the skeletal carbonate of the alga. The amount is influenced by anthropogenic emissions of CO2 that are characterized by isotopically light carbon (12C). Some of this isotopically distinctive CO2 having been discharged into the atmosphere then dissolves into the oceans where it is taken up by the algae (and by corals as well). A multiple site record of δ13C from coralline algae in the Arctic Ocean, meanwhile, reflects

        long-term decline
      </span>
      since the 1850s probably reflecting industrial-era warming (Halfar et al. 2013). In this case, the δ13C reflects changes in the primary production of photosynthetic plankton in the waters which are influenced by the annual duration of sea ice cover. Because photosynthetic plankton preferentially use the lighter isotope of carbon, the ambient waters become enriched in the heavier 13C that the coralline algae then incorporate into their carbonate skeletons.

      An alternative fossil record is grounded in a more harmonious relationship with the biosphere. In a world in which we act fast to avert a mass extinction event, the fossil record would still preserve the basal Anthropocene horizon, already evident by the
      <span resource="#translocation_of_organisms">
        many species we have moved across the world
      </span>
      , but this would soon be followed by a paleontological record of recovery, as ecologies repair themselves. This alternative future can become reality: some human cultures are pathfinders for a more sympathetic relationship with the biosphere. They include the indigenous peoples of Haida Gwaii (British Columbia), who use their coastal ecosystems in a sustainable manner (Eckert et al. 2018). They live alongside their aquatic neighbors without exhausting them. At the global level, effective approaches to maintain biodiversity will require trans-national cooperation, a shift to carbon-neutral energy production, and a concerted effort to save many species on the brink. All of these approaches are feasible, if humans have the will.
