  Extinction, coupled with many other biological signals, is a major geological indicator of the 
  Anthropocene (Barnosky et al. 2011). The introduction of non-native species, deforestation, 
  depletion of fisheries and modification of coastal environments, domestication of animals, 
  and the reconfiguration of terrestrial ecosystems are all evident in the geological record
  and are being explored by the Anthropocene Working Group (AWG) and many other investigators. 
  This essay begins by outlining the geological record of life over four billion years, the calamities
  that have occasionally erased much of its diversity, and the more recent human impacts upon it. We 
  show that lakes, seas, estuaries and wetlands provide important archives of humanity’s reconfiguration 
  of life, and we speculate on the biological and paleontological signature of the near future.

  within a billion years of its formation it was alive.

  For much of geological time life was entirely microbial, but it has grown in mass, organism size, and

The early Earth was a very different place. Anoxic chemistry powered the earliest life, as both the atmosphere 
  and oceans lacked breathable oxygen. By 2.5 billion years ago

  cyanobacteria (“blue-green algae”) had harnessed the energy of light 
  </span>
  to forge biological mass from water and carbon dioxide, releasing oxygen as a “waste” by-product.
  For much of the early life oxygen was toxic, but other organisms learned to use this “waste” to release more energy
  through respiration. The ability of life to reuse “waste” is one of its enduring structures, but human ecologies 
  produce so much that Earth is once again in a phase of toxification.

  2.7 million years ago occurred when North and South America became joined at the Isthmus

       to cross in Mexico—and the absence of placental mammals in the south informed the way that ecosystems
       responded to the exchange. Such insights, even from the remote geological past, can help us to understand
       which of Earth’s ecologies are resilient, and which—like coral reefs and the many species that are nearly
       extinct—may not be.

<h3>Human interaction with the biosphere</h3>

For most of human history our impact on the biosphere was negligible. We lived as hunter-gatherers, subsisting

  replaced the mixed and deciduous forests with artificial grasslands. This allowed weeds like ragweed (the not-so-aptly
  named Ambrosia) to proliferate, to the ongoing dismay of allergy sufferers. Contrary to a popular misconception,
  ragweed was not introduced to North America—it is native to the grasslands in the center of the continent—but the
  abundance of its pollen grains is a marker of regional land clearing throughout eastern North America. In all, some
  95 percent of the Earth’s ice-free landscape is modified in some way by humans (Kennedy et al. 2019); more recently 
  the oceans also show significant evidence of human impact (Halpern et al. 2008).

       we can also add the land appropriated to supply increasing meat consumption, or the use of a wide range of
       agricultural products such as oil palm that find their way into everything from toothpaste to chocolate, all 
       of which brings about a rapid decrease in living space for nonhumans.

<h3>The fossil record of rapid changes to the biosphere</h3>

<p id="P13">
Humans have caused the extinction of other organisms for millennia, moved animals and plants beyond their native ecologies,
  and reconfigured ecosystems. Which of these provide a fossil signature for the Anthropocene?

</p>

<p id="P14">
To define a geological boundary, a surface of equivalent time everywhere is needed—an isochronous surface that can be
       recognized in geological successions globally. Many boundaries in deep time are marked by the first appearance 
       of a particular fossil—such as the mouthparts of a species of marine vertebrates named conodonts in the case of 
       the Triassic System (252 million years ago). This marker, or index fossil, is not present in rocks everywhere, 
       but is sufficiently widespread to enable a chain of correlation with other fossil species of the same age, and 
       with geochemical or other stratigraphical markers. Similar chains of correlation will be needed to identify the 
       Anthropocene.

  from the mid-twentieth century (Cearreta et al. 2002). Biological signals include the total elimination or reduced 
  biodiversity and abundance of the original biota, the replacement of indigenous species—by others more tolerant of 
  pollution, water acidification and salinity change, and competition with non-native species—and deformities in the 
  skeletons of some organisms, resulting from environmental stress.

Lakes are important continental ecosystems that have been cradles of evolution. Human settlements in their catchments
       were provided with freshwater, but the lakes received the waste generated by agriculture and industry, and this
       impairment is recorded by the fossil record of the entire lake ecosystems. The most commonly studied 
       lacustrine microfossils are the glassy remains of diatoms, but many other algae and their consumers—including
       microscopic invertebrates—preserve in the sediments, allowing entire food webs to be reconstructed. Pollen 
       grains and other remains of terrestrial organisms (including pathogens) that blow or wash into lakes link the
       surrounding catchment to the lake, allowing cause and effect to be shown between human activities including land
       clearing and the introduction of exotic species, and the impairment of lake ecosystems. Nutrient loading 
       (eutrophication) has several harmful effects on lakes, including the promotion of harmful algal blooms and 
       the production of anoxic “dead zones.” The associated risks to public health include those posed by harmful
       algal blooms to the municipal water supply of communities. These have drawn a great deal of attention, but
       the stresses placed on ecosystems are visible in the turnover in microfossil assemblages in lake sediments
       long before the impacts are felt directly by humans. For example, lakes in regions with little capacity to
       buffer against acid rain are stressed by mining and smelting ores and the burning of fossil fuels—especially
       sulfur-rich coal. Increased acidity mobilizes toxins, making them bioavailable, and this can be seen in deformities
       in the fossil record of aquatic organisms preserved in the sediments that accumulate in the quiet depths of lake 
       basins. In the best cases, when water does not mix to the lakebed, the past is recorded as annual or even seasonal 
       layers, so that a year-by-year chronicle can be read over thousands of years. These layers of sediment, called
       varves, can be recovered using freeze cores, hollow metal tubes filled with a slurry of dry ice and ethanol 
       that instantly freezes a rind of lake sediment into which it is pushed, and they can be subsampled and analysed
       to provide annual resolution for chemical, physical or biological constituents of the lake’s sediment archive.

Knowing how reef ecologies responded to past environmental change (including past mass extinction events) might provide 
       insights to future patterns (Leinfelder 2019). Some living reefs thrive in muddy and silty conditions, often in 
       nutrient-rich shallow waters that still resemble the habitats of ancient reefs. With extensive mitigation including
       preventing overfishing, coastal pollution, and urbanization—and above all, reducing greenhouse gas emissions—coral 
       reefs can continue to grow, albeit in a different form, and possibly thrive well into the future.

Recent coral skeletons also preserve a record of environmental change over hundreds of years

  to months, which makes them the prime archive in tropical oceans. They also record nuclear fallout from weapons testing,
  pollution, sedimentation, acidification, sea surface saltiness, temperature changes, and changes in skeletal chemistry 
  attributed to the uptake of atoms of carbon derived from the burning of fossil fuels. Corals then offer a high precision 
  tool for establishing when the Anthropocene began (Waters et al. 2018).

Because thousands of different species both on the land and in the sea have been translocated across the Earth, and because 
       there are myriad other geological signals by which to build a chain of correlation, the fossil record of the Anthropocene
       in a coral reef can be linked with records from around the world, including those in colder and deeper waters where
       coralline algae take over as precise recorders of environmental change. Coralline algae are particularly sensitive
       proxies of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), which is important for understanding atmosphere-ocean interactions.

       the skeletal carbonate of the alga. The amount is influenced by anthropogenic emissions of CO2 that are characterized
       by isotopically light carbon (12C). Some of this isotopically distinctive CO2 having been discharged into the
       atmosphere then dissolves into the oceans where it is taken up by the algae (and by corals as well). A multiple site

       are influenced by the annual duration of sea ice cover. Because photosynthetic plankton preferentially use the lighter
       isotope of carbon, the ambient waters become enriched in the heavier 13C that the coralline algae then incorporate into 
       their carbonate skeletons.

An alternative fossil record is grounded in a more harmonious relationship with the biosphere. In a world in which we act fast 
       to avert a mass extinction event, the fossil record would still preserve the basal Anthropocene horizon, already evident
       by the 
       <span resource="#translocation_of_organisms">
       many species we have moved across the world

       , but this would soon be followed by a paleontological record of recovery
       , as ecologies repair themselves. This alternative future can become reality: some human cultures are pathfinders for 
       a more sympathetic relationship with the biosphere. They include the indigenous peoples of Haida Gwaii (British Columbia),
       who use their coastal ecosystems in a sustainable manner (Eckert et al. 2018). They live alongside their aquatic neighbors
       without exhausting them. At the global level, effective approaches to maintain biodiversity will require trans-national
       cooperation, a shift to carbon-neutral energy production, and a concerted effort to save many species on the brink. All of
       these approaches are feasible, if humans have the will.
