Of course, radioactivity is a natural process on which our very existence depends, whether it be in the form of solar radiation or the internal heating of our planet. But it has only been within the last century that humans have explored radioactivity’s potential for manipulation as a tool or weapon and developed novel artificial radionuclides.

This discovery, and the subsequent realization of the energy release that could be generated by this process (if the fission reaction also emitted enough secondary neutrons, a chain reaction could potentially occur, releasing enormous amounts of energy, Figure 1), made the development of an atomic bomb a theoretical possibility — a possibility taken to its military conclusion in the Manhattan Project.

      , fission products effectively form two fragments of the fissioned or split nucleus, most commonly with atomic masses of 90–100 and 130–140. Fission products range in half-life (specifically, the time taken for half of the original radioactive atoms present to decay) from fractions of a second to thousands of years. They typically decay to a stable isotope form by emission of beta particles (electrons ejected from a radioactive nucleus following the splitting of a neutron into a proton and electron, Figure 1) and gamma-ray photons (packets of energy emitted by the nucleus). Common fission products include isotopes of iodine, caesium, strontium, xenon, and barium.

      The post-fallout behavior of these radionuclides depends on their chemistry and the characteristics of the environment into which they are deposited. H-3, for example, is a readily soluble radionuclide which can be used as an environmental tracer of seawater circulation, groundwater movement, and pollution, while other products (Pu, Am isotopes) show stronger interaction with biological tissues or sedimentary particles. The more particle-reactive radionuclides show strong interaction with the sedimentary and biological materials that make up the Earth’s stratigraphic record. For example, the

      in 1963–1964 (Figure 3) can be detected in most carbon reservoirs, including peat deposits, soil, wood, coral, and bone. Pu isotopes readily associate with clays and organic particles in lake, marine, and other settings, allowing characterization of distinct fallout signatures in marine and lake sediments, ice cores, and other media. While 
      <span resource="#plutonium">
        plutonium

      is typically immobile once deposited it can, however, migrate in acidic peat profiles, adding anthropogenic

      . Similarly, the C-14 present in deep marine sediments, which represent some of the key materials preserved in the geological record, records a mixed signal of atmospheric and ocean carbon pools. The delay in isotopes settling through the water column can cause significant lags in peak signals, suggesting that analysis of shallow marine sediments or corals is preferable over deep marine sediments. In addition, globally, not all sites are equally exposed to historical fallout—deposition of fallout products was highest in the mid-latitudes (particularly the Northern Hemisphere mid-latitudes, Figure 2), meaning that more pronounced signals are preserved at sites in these regions.

      Measuring the Fingerprint
    </h3>

      Fingerprinting a particular radionuclide typically uses one of four techniques, three focused on radioactivity, and one on mass. The radioactivity (in becquerels (Bq), or atomic disintegrations per second) of a sample can be measured using a range of methods, depending on the type of particle or energy emitted by the radionuclide.
    </p>

    <p id="P17" prefix="time: http://www.w3.org/2006/time# ac: http://anthropocene-curriculum.org/tbd rdfs: http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#">
      Alpha spectrometry uses passive semiconductor detectors to count (and determine the energies of) alpha particles emitted from radionuclides which have been extracted from environmental samples and plated onto a metal disk, which is held under a high vacuum. In effect, the detector records the energy pulse deposited as an alpha particle collides with it, and converts the pulse amplitude into an energy. Alpha particles are emitted with characteristic energies, and this allows the different isotopes present to be differentiated and quantified.

      Liquid scintillation counting is a common method for the measurement of beta-emitting radionuclides and some alpha-emitters. It involves dissolving or suspending the active sample in a liquid scintillator (typically a “cocktail” of solvent, surfactant and "fluors" or scintillators), and counting the resultant photon emissions caused by the interaction of the beta or alpha emissions with the cocktail.

      Gamma spectrometry involves the use of an energy-sensitive radiation detector (commonly sodium iodide (NaI) scintillation counters or high-purity germanium detectors) to detect gamma-ray photons and produce a gamma-ray energy spectrum that can resolve the characteristic gamma energies of different radionuclides.

      Mass spectrometry, in contrast, measures the very small masses of radionuclide present in a sample rather than activity.  Despite the large amounts of fallout initially released, for many 
      <span resource="#radioactive_fallout">
        fallout products 
      </span>
      the actual present mass is very small — for example, the estimated global release of Sr-90 from 
      <span resource="#atmospheric_detonation">
        atmospheric weapons testing 
      </span>
      was approximately 600 PBq (6 x 1017 Bq), which equates to a total mass of just over 100 kg. Mass spectrometric methods are generally applied for highly precise measurements on longer-lived radionuclides. Recent instrumental advances mean that medium-lived fission products such as Cs-137 (in addition to longer lived actinides such as various isotopes of 
      <span resource="#uranium">
        U 
      </span>
      and 
      <span resource="#plutonium">
        Pu
      </span>
      ) can now be measured using research laboratory-based mass spectrometers, while more expensive accelerator mass spectrometers (AMS) are used for applications such as very low-level C-14 measurement (10-12 to 10-15 14C/12C for radiocarbon dating) and trace actinide analysis (at sub-femtogram (10-15 gram) per gram concentrations). The sensitivity of the AMS technique can be illustrated by recent work on Pu-244, proposed as an indicator of past supernova events that may have triggered epoch-ending mass extinction events in deep geological time (such as at the end of the Devonian period), which use extended AMS counting to determine input rates of 15 atoms per cm2 per million years in deep sea Fe/Mn ocean crust (Wallner et al. 2015).

      It is these techniques, in combination, that we are using to assess the 
      <span resource="#global_fingerprint">

      </span>
      in the various geological archives of our candidate Global Boundary Stratotype Section and Point (GSSP) sites for the 
      <span resource="#anthropocene">
        Anthropocene
      </span>
      . For example, at our Baltic Sea candidate site, sediments are extracted using sediment coring from ships, and the sediment cores are then split into fine depth intervals. Sediments from each of these depth intervals are sent to various laboratories for measurement of key potential

      markers—including 
      <span resource="#radioactive_fallout">
        radioactive fallout 
      </span>
      products. How we measure the different fallout products depends mainly on the decay mode of the radionuclide of interest, any measurement interferences, and its half-life. Taking 
      <span resource="#plutonium">
        plutonium 
      </span>
      as an example, sediments are dried, and the 
      <span resource="plutonium">
        Pu 
      </span>
      is extracted using strong acids. From this point, the extract is split, with a fraction going on to alpha spectrometric analysis for the alpha-particle emitting Pu-238, another (for the beta-emitter Pu-241) for liquid scintillation counting, and a third to high resolution mass spectrometric analysis, which determines Pu-239 and Pu-240 and their ratio. This provides the fingerprint that can discriminate the early

      accident, and helps to determine the basal 
      <span resource="#anthropocene">

      point in the sediment archive. Radiocarbon analysis involves selection of carbon, which registered the atmospheric 14C signal at the time of deposition. In an ideal case, terrestrial plant remains are chosen (Hajdas 2008, 2009). For the Baltic Sea sediments, total organic carbon is used, and the subsequent AMS analysis (Synal et al. 2007) requires 0.5–1 mg of carbon. The results derived are expressed as F14C or “Fraction Modern” (Reimer et al., 2004), the measured 14C content normalized to the pre-bomb values. Values of F14C greater than 1 can be expected to follow the Pu peak.
